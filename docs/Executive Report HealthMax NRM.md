## Key Insights

### Market & Category
- The **Organic** subcategory showed the highest growth between 2018 and 2022, creating an opportunity for HealthMax to expand market share in this segment.  
- *Starbust*, a HealthMax brand, achieved its **highest market share in 2023 within the South region**, outperforming other regions.  
- The total category turnover (MAT, March 2023) reached **$140,958,153**.

### Profitability
- Weighted average gross margin was computed across products, enabling comparison of profitability by SKU.  
- A profitability vs. contribution scatter plot highlighted **which products combine strong margins with significant net sales contribution**.  
- Simulation of a new **50ml pack size** for *Starbust Ultra Soft* indicated a **70% gross margin** and potential **gross profit of $185,015.68**, despite lower expected volume (10% of the 100ml format).

### Promotions
- Analysis of three campaigns for *Shinez* (2022) revealed that the **“Buy 2, Get 1 Free” promotion delivered the highest ROI**, outperforming alternative mechanics.

### Forecasting
- Based on historical external and internal sales data, **Net Sales for 2023 were projected to decline by 0.93% vs. 2022**.  
- **2024 Net Sales were forecasted to grow 3.99% vs. 2022 and 4.975% vs. 2023**, assuming no additional initiatives.

### Net Revenue Management (NRM) Initiatives
- A waterfall analysis incorporated **natural growth, Herbashine (Organic launch), and 50ml Shampoo format**.  
- **Estimated Net Sales 2024 with NRM:** **$24,805,694.99**.  
- Growth comparison:  
  - Without NRM → **4.98% growth**.  
  - With NRM → **16.46% growth** (+ **$3,506,242.32** incremental value).  
- **Herbashine** (Organic segment) projected to be the main profit driver among new launches.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Accelerate presence in the Organic subcategory**, leveraging the Herbashine launch.  
2. **Adopt selective pack-size innovation** (e.g., 50ml SKUs) to capture high-margin, trial-oriented segments.  
3. **Prioritize promotions with proven ROI mechanics** (e.g., “Buy 2, Get 1 Free”) while reducing inefficient ones.  
4. **Monitor MAT vs. YTD KPIs** to smooth seasonality and track true underlying growth.  
5. **Balance natural category growth with targeted NRM initiatives** to achieve sustainable double-digit revenue growth.
